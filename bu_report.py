    Weekly Executive IT Report - {email_date}
    
    In the past week Nexthink saw {device_count_total} devices

    Of those {device_count_total}:

    Network: 
    •	{device_count_less_than_50_percent_connection_ratio} devices had a less than 50% successful connection ratio
    •	{device_count_between_50_and_75_percent_connection_ratio} devices have between 50% and 75% successful connection ratio
    •	{device_count_over_100ms_response_time} devices have over 100ms average network response rate     

    Hardware:
    •	{device_count_8gb} devices have 8GB of RAM 
    •	{device_count_g3_or_older} devices are a G3 model or older
    
    Performance:
    •	{device_count_slow_boot} devices take longer than 2 minutes to boot 
    •	{device_count_slow_extended_logon} devices take longer than 5 minutes to complete extended logon (device ready to use)
    •	{device_count_100_percent_high_mem_time} devices are spending 100% of their time at high memory usage
    •	{device_count_between_50_and_100_percent_high_mem_time} devices spend between 50% and 100% of their time at high memory usage 
    •	The worst performing device by CPU usage ({highest_cpu_device}), spent {highest_cpu}% of its time at high CPU usage
    •	The device with the most app crashes ({most_app_crash_device}), had {most_app_crash_device_crash_count} application crashes over the 7 day period
    •	{device_count_over_10_app_crashes} devices had over 10 app crashes
